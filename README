About
=====

 Chromium extension to fill input with a random password. This is not
published on the Chrome Web Store because I don't see why it should
be - I don't imagine it's the most secure or sane way of doing it;
and it is designed to be configured in source. To side-load this
plugin: download the source, enable developer mode in the extensions
menu, then click `Load unpacked` and navigate to the downloaded
extension source.

Motive
======

 As a Mozilla Firefox user, I quite like being able to generate
passwords in-browser, but was slightly upset when I tried Vivaldi as
it does not offer this functionality.


Configuration
=============
 Edit the two const values in `src/background.js`, and then click 
`Update` in the extensions menu.


Roadmap
=======
v1.0.1:
    - Update to MV3
      [https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/]
v1.0.2:
    - Autofill this generated password to all
      `<input type="password">`s on page (similar to Mozilla Firefox)
