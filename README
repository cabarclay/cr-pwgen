About
=====

 Chromium extension to fill input with a random password. This is not
published on the Chrome Web Store (CWS) as it currently uses MV2 and 
is only configurable in the source. It is planned to fix both of
these things (as much as I like the pseudo-suckless nature of the
configuration) at which point it will be published onto the CWS.


Support
=======

 This plugin *should* just work on at least the most up-to-date (at 
time of writing) versions of Chrome and Chromium-based browsers.


Installation
============

1. Download the source
2. Side-load the plugin: 
    - Enable developer mode in the extensions menu 
    - Then click `Load unpacked` and navigate to the downloaded
      extension source.
    - On future updates, the extension can then be similarly
      `Update`d.

It is recommended to remove the extension button, as this does not
yet provide any functionality.


Motive
======

 As a Mozilla Firefox user, I quite like being able to generate
passwords in-browser, but was slightly upset when I tried Vivaldi as
it does not offer this functionality.


Configuration
=============

 Edit the two const values in `src/background.js`, and then click 
`Update` in the extensions menu.


Roadmap
=======
v1.0.1:
    - Update to MV3
      [https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/]
v1.1.0:
    - Autofill this generated password to all
      `<input type="password">`s on page (similar to Mozilla Firefox)
v1.2.0:
    - Move configuration to a popup.
    - Publish to CWS.
